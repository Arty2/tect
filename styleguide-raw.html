At first I had supposed <strong>the dead man's chest</strong> to be that identical big box of his upstairs in the front room, and the thought had been mingled in my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightmare">nightmares</a> with that of the one-legged seafaring man <ins datetime="2013-07-15T01:02EET">with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser">laser</a> equipped pet <del>shark</del> parrot</ins>.

But by this time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the <b>song</b>; it was new, that night, to nobody but <abbr title="Doctor">Dr.</abbr> Livesey, and on him I observed it did not produce an <em>agreeable effect</em>, for he looked up for a moment quite angrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on a <mark>new cure</mark> for the rheumatics.

 <p class="column">In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week after week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had been long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more. If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my poor father out of the room. I have seen him wringing his hands after such a rebuff, and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his early and unhappy death.</p>

 <p class="columns smaller">All the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker. One of the cocks of his hat having fallen down, he let it hang from that day forth, though it was a great annoyance when it blew. I remember the appearance of his coat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before the end, was nothing but patches. He never wrote or received a letter, and he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these, for the most part, only when drunk on rum. The great sea-chest none of us had ever seen open.</p>
