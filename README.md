tect • an architect's WordPress theme
===================================

> Safe to deploy, but still experimental!


This theme aims to:
-----------------------------------
* Be an unobtrusive, contemporary and responsive, suitable for visual designers and writers.
* Be a deployable ecosystem with own plugin functions and style classes.
* Pose as a semantic HTML5 and CSS3 snob experiment, which degrades (almost) gracefully for older browsers.
* Break free from WordPress' dated content behaviors, bad output code and template–like PHP code.
* Be suitable for bilingual users. English & Greek localization included.

Included enhancements
-----------------------------------
These "plugins" cannot are currently always on.
* [Magnific Popup](https://github.com/dimsemenov/Magnific-Popup)
* [Prism.js](http://www.prismjs.com)

Suggested plugins & settings
-----------------------------------
* [Magic Widgets](http://wordpress.org/plugins/magic-widgets/)
* [Polylang](http://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) (theme uses own language switcher when plugin is enabled)
	* ☑ Hide URL language information for default language.
	* ☐ Activate languages and translations for media. (poorly applied)
	* ☐ Synchronization: Custom fields. (they may be translatable)

Known bugs / Undocumented behaviors
-----------------------------------
* Caption shortcode requires width=1 for fluid width.
* It is suggested to use full-size for images if you want them to be fluid, filesize will be addressed with a plugin in the future.
* RSS feeds have not been tested thus they may not work as expected.
* If your blog already contains media, they may not work as expected.
* Visual editor calls for images in the wrong directory resulting in 404.


To-do
-----------------------------------

### high priority
* Always complete Greek l10n.

### low priority
* Fix visual editor bug.
* Rethink archive view and work it from scratch.
* Enable and make use of [Post Formats](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats)
* Clean useless code WordPress includes in the header by default.
* Theme options:
	* twitter handle
	* Categories that are displayed in homepage. (default: all)
	* Media directory → /media (default: true)
	* Hyper-relative links toggle. (default: true)
	* Prism.js and Magnific Popup toggle. (default: true)
	* Google Analytics
* Flexbox CSS at .gallery.
* Turn styleguide-raw.html into a proper accompanying page. (you can currently Copy & Paste the code into a post)
* Resolve issues with Hyperlink index.
* Test and work on Pagination.
* Test and work on RSS feeds.
* Test if sticky posts work.
* Test if what works for Posts, works for Pages as well.
* Better theme logo. (SVG?)
* Add Location custom field. ([Google Maps](http://bigsaturday.net/oembed-google-maps-wordpress/) / OpenStreetMaps oEmbed?)
* Simplify CSS selectors and remove redundant !importants
* Add download related media link and field. (?)
* Ensure output code has better linebreaks.
* Fine tune .gallery: caption instead of title, link to file by default.

### even lower priority
* Singled-out page template for cleaner .html (offline) copies of content.
* Pretty ampersands and perhaps Twitter, Facebook icons via (custom font)[http://www.heydonworks.com/article/font-hacking].
* Semantic HTML for [curator’s code](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/03/09/curators-code/).
* Write documentation on styles.
* Add style options to Customizer:
	* custom background
	* logo height
	* text colors
	* link colors

### may never happen priority
* Add buttons and proper display styles for original classes to the Visual editor.
